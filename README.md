# movie-board
Re-design and implement Douban Movie using React and Redux.
There's no 3rd party UI libraries used in this project.
All components are designed and implemented only for this project.

## Online Demo @ Daocloud
http://henryli-movie-board.daoapp.io/
> Since it's running on a free Docker host, I just can't guarantee it would be always working.
